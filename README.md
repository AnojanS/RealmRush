A 3D tower defense game built in Unity and programmed in C#. Users strategically place towers by clicking on a legal spot on the grid in order to prevent enemy bots from reaching the user's base. Players can only place a maximum of three towers on the grid and can relocate their towers at anytime. Towers shoot at the closest enemy bot whom themselves take the shortest possible route to the user's base using a breadth-first search algorithm.
